view of Rust's lifetime which is dual to the traditional one in\n\nAnother view of Rust's lifetime\n\nToday, let's try to make it a concrete algorithm demo based on Polonius.\nTo formally and clearly describe the core rules of the algorithm, I want to use a special DSL which is drived from Datalog:\nMeta-language\nThe lanugage we use to describe rules has only 2 basic components:\nAtomic entity\nIf a entity derives itself, we call it atomic entity (usually they are the input of the algorithm). For instance:\n\nWe can also view this entity as a type:\n\nWe use a spectial kind Input to imply that the entity is atomic.\nDerived entity\nThis kind of entities can be derived from others (even recursively!):\n\nHere trans serves as a deriving rule.\nMaterials\nBefore demonstrating the whole algorithm, we firstly prepare some materials to cook.\n$G$ the CFG\nAs in the traditional algorithm, we need the Control Flow Graph(CFG), denoted $G$, to help us trace program and memory flow.\nThe CFG comprises set of MIR Point, denoted $P$ and control flow edges between points $E$.\nTo get the source and destination of one edge, we have two functions:\n\nSince we are working on the meta-language, we say edge e exists by:\n\nNormally, we denote one edge as edge a b by its end points.\n$R$ the Regions\nRegion is the core concept of the borrow checker.\nThen what do we mean by a region?\nLet's consider how to assemble references and memory locations in Rust!\nBasically, we use product type, or, if you like, structs:\n\nSimilarly, We just define regions as products of references.\nHowever, as we want to be more specific here, we call referred references loans:\n\nRegions are sets of loans.\n\nMoreover, since regions can be viewed as sets, we then have subset relations which is explored in the next section.\n$L$ the Loans\nIn the previous part, we used loans to define regions.\nLoans can be viewed as any borrow sites.\nFor example:\n\nHere, the region 'a would correspond to the set {L0, L1}, since it may refer to data produced by the loan L0, but it may also refer to data from the loan L1.\nRelations\nInjection\nWe mentioned that regions can form subset relations.\nBut we can say more general here by defining relation structures between regions at the same point.\n\nTo simplify the notation a little, we denote a in b at p just as in p a b.\n\nAlso, we have some input injection relations:\n\nand one more rule:\n\nLiveness\na region 'a is live at some point P if some reference with type &amp;'a i32 may be dereferenced later:\n\nWe also talk about liveness of loans:\n\nWhat's require here?\nRequirement\nrequire R L P means:\n\nIf the terms of the loan L are violated at the point P, then the region R is invalidated.\n\nFormally:\n\nand rules:\n\nInvalidation\nAnd now finally we can define what a borrow check error is.\nBefore that, We need to define an input invalidates(P, L),\nwhich indicates that some access or action at the point P invalidates the terms of the loan L:\n\nErrors\nFinally\n\nRefinement\nThe core algorithm is rather coarse.\nWe need refinements to handle reassignment and reborrow problems.\nReassignment\nReborrow\n","id":"https://noteoverflow.github.io/posts/another-view-of-rust-s-lifetime-ii-the-algorithm/","title":"Another view of Rust's lifetime II - The algorithm"},"https://noteoverflow.github.io/posts/another-view-of-rusts-lifetime/":{"body":"Compared with Haskell, Rust is different for its effect system and ownership system.\nInside ownership system, lifetime plays an important role on borrowing and safety.\nTraditionally, people think about lifetime as some region of code, which is a little kind of vague.\nWhy not try to see lifetime as a kind of memory(dependency) reference?\nLifetime as scope?\nThe Rust book suggests viewing lifetime as scopes. Consider a simple example:\n\nSince x's lifetime 'b is shorter than r's 'a, we cannot assign &amp;x to r.\nHowever, this reason is rather imprecise.\nIf we simply remove the last println! line, this code just compile fine.:\n\nWhy?\nEven worse, lifetime can contain holes, where it’s intermittently invalid between where it starts and where it ultimately ends. For example, let's change our previous code simply:\n\nThis time the code compiles. Surprise!\nWhy? why this code compiles fine?? If r's lifetime coprresponds to x's reference, why r can br printed outside x's scope now? There may exist holes in lifetime.\nApparently scope view is not correct. We need something better.\nLifetime as regions of code?\nRustonomicon the book suggests viewing lifetime as named regions of code.\nNow our previous problems are solved, since 'r spans only its valid data flow regions and the regions can contains arbitrary holes.\n\nLifetime is named regions of code where the pointed data is valid.\n\nWhat about lifetime constraints like 'a: 'b?\nLifetime subtyping\nSubtyping is really just a spectial relation just as other traits can represent.\nThe only subtyping in rust is lifetime subtyping.\n\nif 'b outlives 'a, then 'b: 'a and &amp;'b T is a subtype of &amp;'a T.\n\nSince &amp;'b T is a subtype of &amp;'a T, we can assign any &amp;'b T to &amp;'a T.\nFor example(again from the rust book):\n\nActually, this code cannot compile without lifetime subtyping. It's equivalent to this code:\n\nAutomatic subtyping is only a fancy and convenient way to expression this relationship.\nLifetime as memory references\nIf you know category theory, you may heard of duality.\nJust like category theory, the code region view also has its DUAL view:\n\nA lifetime refers to some memory or other resources and\nconstraint 'a: 'b can also be read 'a refers to a subset of 'b or, if you like, 'a in 'b.\n\nIn this dual view, if 'a outlives 'b, 'b contains more resources than 'a does.\nI find this view is somehow complement to the region view.\nLet's demonstrate this view with the following code:\n\n\nwhere arrow -&gt; means point to some resource and {} means union.\nFrom this graph, we can easily conclude:\n\n","id":"https://noteoverflow.github.io/posts/another-view-of-rusts-lifetime/","title":"Another view of Rust's lifetime"},"https://noteoverflow.github.io/posts/bash-may-swallow-signals/":{"body":"Recently I encountered a confusing bug:\n\nA simple eprintln! in Rust may cause panic!\n\nThat sounds weird, right?\nLet's check the eprintln!'s doc:\n\nPrints to the standard error, with a newline.\nEquivalent to the println! macro, except that output goes to\nio::stderr instead of io::stdout.

But quickly I noticed that the rust program's stderr was been redirected to another process's input.\nNow the problem seems to be clear:\n\nThe process which redireced Rust's program's stderr exits, then eprintln! writes to broken pipe and panic!\n\nBut why? Why still write to stderr when something is broken?\nBash launched bash\nI noticed that the launch shell did not directly exec Rust program.\nIn stead, it call bash on another bash script which exec the real program.\nFor a minimal example:\n\nWhen we run the launch.sh:\n\nWe create 2 processed: bash lanuch.sh and program.\nIt seems still fine.

Any traditional algorithm which can be finished in finite steps can also be expressed with lambda calculus and recursions. In a nutshell, lambda calculus is turing complete!\n\nThe ultimate principal\nWait! Our mission should be positing a uniform principal of problem solving.\nWhy bother wasting time on lambda calculus and recursions?\nNow let me show you the magic! It can be described informally as:\n\nAll problems can be deconstructed by its input, output and side-effect.\nWe can recursively divide the problem until we can solve it trivially.\nFinally, we merge all recursive solutions and get the global solution.\n\nActually, there's nothing novel here. This principal is just trying to reintroduce one archaic motto:\n\nAll algorithms can be constructed by divide and conquer.\n\nThe only difference is that the archaic principal said nothing about what to divide.\nAlthough this principal is so simple that it's even hard to be seen as a discovery, to actually use it, it's much much hard and there exists so many pitfalls.\nMost pitfalls are basically that, most materials and people failed to follow the principal， let alone finding tricks of it. Here I only enumerate some of crux tricks (someday I may write a systemaic book on this).\nTricks\nRecursion as loops\nAll recursions can be converted to equivalent version of loops with extra data structure(such as stack).\nIn fact, all stack based compilers do this for you automatically.\n\n\nshow one perticular example\n\nNot only input, but also output!\nOne common misunderstanding is problems can only be divided by input.\nIn practice, dividing output is quite useful and ubiquitous.\nWhenever you have difficulty dividing on input, just try output!\n\nAll information (data) representing part of the problem can be divided.\nAlthough different dividing startegies can lead to different complexities.\n\nRecursion on side effect\nMany people insist that many problems can not be solve by divide and conquer as the dividing is not local and cannot be merged into the global solution. However, they all ignored some very critical aspect: the side-effect of functions (algorithms).\nIn theory, side-effect should be anything that can influence referential transparency.\nThe most interesting fact is that, if you think carefully, effects can be classified into compile-time and run-time.\nRun-time effect: extra information\nFor a problem, the result of our recursion is not simply returning a local solution in most scenarios. I find that we usually need additional recursive information. This is a bit abstract, so let me give you an example, using the sliding window that we often see:\nSliding windows are typically described by divide and conquer:\nfor an input list, decompose it into a list consisting of the last element and all the previous elements.\nAssuming that I have obtained the solution of all the previous elements (except the last element) through recursion, then we will find that the solution of the first half alone is not enough to support us to get a new solution after incorporating the last element.\nSo we can simply include an additional information, that is, assume that the recursion of the first half can return us an additional information,\nthis additional information contains some information about the sequence adjacent to the last element (in fact, this sequence is what many people call a sliding window).\nUsing this additional information, we find that we can easily update the global solution.\nOf course, don't forget that this extra information is recursive. When you require the first half to recursively return the extra information, you must also be able to return the updated extra information (which can be compared to the sliding update of a sliding window). Similarly, if you want to get extra information you want from the upper layer, make sure you can then provide it to the next layer. Although the sliding window is used as an example here, the application scope of the extra information technique is actually much more than that. You will find that monotone stacks, double pointers, prefix sums, etc. are all just special cases of extra information recursion.\nCompile-time effect: constraints and proofs\nCompile-time effects are rare to mention but also ubiquitous!\nBesides decomposing on run-time data, you can even divide constraints (proofs)!\nIf you are familiar with dependent type theory, then this is much natural.\nDivide one aspect at a time, never both\nSo you start trying to decompose any data that you think might be useful, but remember never to consider decomposition in multiple dimensions.\nInstead, decompose the first data (dimension) first, and then consider whether to decompose the second dimension. Otherwise, you will definitely fall into chaos.\nThe most typical example is high-dimensional dynamic optimization.\nFor this kind of problem, you must not rush to decompose it all at once, as you cannot eat hot tofu in a hurry.\nDefer dividing\nActually, most problems tagged easy and medium can be divided directly by its input and output.\nThe real hard part is lying under the target to be divided.\nFor instance, in designing the famous quick sort, one learns to rearrange the target array before dividing and recursion. the rearrange can effecttively efface the cost of merging after the recursion which is inevitable in merge sort.\nMoreover, many hard problems do not directly divide on input or output, nor the given effects.\nTo solve them, one need to design and find a way to effectively construct a new data structure to be divided and recur.\nReuse space\nWhen you try to design additional information again, you may find that the memory used to store the additional information can be reused. In this case, you must try to reuse this memory, which can usually greatly reduce space complexity.\nCaching\nDon't be afraid of dynamic programming.\nJust list the recursive formula of recursive divide and conquer, and then use a hashMap to cache the results.\nIf you find that there is no circular dependency in the recursion, then you don't even need a hash.\nA simple array plus the space reuse mentioned above can solve all dynamic programming.\nPruning\nSubproblems can be pruned. Greedy algorithms and early termination with backtracking are both trivially applicable.\nCatamorphisms and recursion schemes\nF-algebra\n\n\ncomplete formal description after\n\nBasic cata\n\nThe dividing-and-conquer part can be described by catamorphism.\nHowever, in many situations, one need to find a effective target data structure to be divided first which is the real enigma.

1) - 2) + ((9 - 4) - 2) = 8\n\n解\n看似变化不规则，其实只是在组合额外信息的时候注意减去手续费即可。\n\n含冷冻期\n题\n给定一个整数数组prices，其中第  prices[i] 表示第 i 天的股票价格 。​\n设计一个算法计算出最大利润。在满足以下约束条件下，你可以尽可能地完成更多的交易（多次买卖一支股票）:\n卖出股票后，你无法在第二天买入股票 (即冷冻期为 1 天)。\n注意：你不能同时参与多笔交易（你必须在再次购买前出售掉之前的股票）。\n\n示例 1:\n输入: prices = [1,2,3,0,2]\n输出: 3\n解释: 对应的交易状态为: [买入, 卖出, 冷冻期, 买入, 卖出]\n\n解\n这里额外的信息需要间隔一天之前交易完成的最大利润和前面一天刚交易完成的最大利润，其他和前面题目没什么区别；\n\n","id":"https://noteoverflow.github.io/posts/conquer-leetcode-best-time-buy-sell-stocks/","title":"分治 leetcode「买股票的最佳时间」系列问题"},"https://noteoverflow.github.io/posts/digimon-exhibition/":{"body":"今天看到了数码宝贝的展览，就顺道去参观了一下；整体办的内容有限（甚至有点简陋，电话亭居然不能用！），不过确实勾起了不少回忆。\n似乎基本主要是90年代末左右的人会关注digimon，大概是因为那段时间电视上有播放吧。\n整个展厅是顺着动画的剧情时间轴去布置的，每个展厅代表一个动画的篇章：\n\n一开始看到的是成长期的进化画面(巴鲁兽卖萌ing)\n\n还记得幼年期第一期进化的场景（虽然在悬崖边掉到了河里）。\n在理解了数码宝贝世界基本的世界观之后，我们的小队很快遇到了恶魔兽。小时候觉得恶魔兽引诱孩子们进别墅的情节非常经典，其中有幅画似乎在暗示天使与恶魔同在。\n\n接下来我们就遇到了悟空兽，除了悟空兽的出场BGM之外，我印象最深的还是暴龙兽的错误进化，这也让太一第一次开始思考鲁莽与勇气之间的区别。\n\n除了恶魔，西方另一个经典的形象就是吸血鬼，所以接下来我们又遇到了吸血魔兽，某种意义上算是恶魔兽的加强版，也是这一段剧情了拓展了数码宝贝的世界观，发现数码世界是与现实世界相连的（这一设定十分超前，其中也深化了动画的主题，引入了家庭、父母、同龄人、虚拟与现实之间的关系探讨）：\n\n可惜没有看到南瓜兽和矿石兽的万圣节之旅，我永远也忘不了这个情节。\n正当我们以为打败吸血魔兽就可以恢复虚拟与现实之间的秩序之时，又出现了黑暗四天王，其中我印象最深的还是小丑皇，最绝望的时刻，只剩下希望：\n\n\n最后的最后，实际上最终的boss是所有不幸的digimon的怨念，没有人为他们伸张权利，一切都是优胜劣汰的自然法则。到这里，伴着回到现实的列车和butterfly，我和主角小队们一同回到了现实。\n\n临走的时候，发现还有战斗暴龙兽的雕像\n\n最后我买了一个盲盒，居然真的抽中了我编程的启蒙大佬光子郎：\n\n","id":"https://noteoverflow.github.io/posts/digimon-exhibition/","title":"数码宝贝展览"},"https://noteoverflow.github.io/posts/distractions/":{"body":"记得《赌博默示录》中曾经有一个片段，开司在进行一次生死难料的赌局之时，有了一个大胆的猜想也许能赢。\n可这毕竟是场赌局，输了便会万劫不复。这时开司突然明白了一件事，原来重要的是自己内心的声音，他人的声音，自己的畏惧与对失败的焦虑，突然消失了。\n\n\n\n当时我没有细想，只觉得也许是开司信念上更坚定了，今天我突然发现其中还藏着更有趣的东西。\n近来很多事情不顺，一度陷入焦虑，不知不觉对外界与自身都充满了迷茫。\n在经历了许许多多的痛苦、失眠与神经紊乱之后，我突然感到了原来这一切都是我自身，或是称其为潜意识，在向我传达某种想法与愿望。\n这让我突然想起了很久之前看过的一部漫画《汤神君没有朋友》。\n其中有一段故事，男主汤神的朋友藤泽被他人说和汤神性格相似，\n而汤神在学校中有名的不受待见，便有些难过，但仔细想来，还真觉得自己也许和汤神有些相似。\n工作上对周围的同事不认真工作不满，对身边同学不认真做好事情而生气，对自己无力掌控外在而怀疑自己，对自己不能心胸宽广而批评自我，进而对自己的未来产生焦虑。\n当藤泽偶然间跟汤神提起觉得自己和和他相似时，没想到汤神毫不留情地说自己和她完全不同，他从来不烦恼和焦虑这些事情。\n藤泽十分惊讶，问汤神为什么，汤神说他发现：\n\n众多烦恼的根源在于不明白自身的愿望，不知道自己的想法。正因为不知道自己的愿望，而过多地把自己的精神能量分散到了外界被消耗掉。\n\n汤神说完，藤泽突然感到原来自己的愿望并不在这些事情上，烦恼和焦虑也顿时不再在意。\n\n\n\n我觉得故事不止于此。我突然感到大家常说的「摒弃杂念」和「专心致志」不过是一种外在的、事后的评价和总结，并非真正的内因。\n而内因，或者说「真正的愿望」，又或者简言之「真意」其实就在「杂念」之中。之所以痛苦、焦虑、折磨，其实是自身在向自身传达「真意」与「愿望」。\n若能正视自己的愿望，进而在这一过程中不断认识自己，认识周围的环境与联系，便会感到精神力原来是充实的。\n换言之，正视自己的想法、杂念和愿望，察觉到其中的真意，便会发现原来当真是\n\n菩提本无树，何处惹尘埃\n\n所有的困难、失意此刻都开始熠熠生辉，人生进而感到神清气爽，不再患得患失。\n对事物看法的改变背后，其内因是对自己所行之道的由内而外的享受与坚定，热爱自己与道路上的风景。\n\n\n","id":"https://noteoverflow.github.io/posts/distractions/","title":"此中有真意"},"https://noteoverflow.github.io/posts/evil-of-abusing-syntax/":{"body":"It took me about one week until I realized that I misunderstood the meaning of the expression syntax in the paper.\nOperator priorities are rediculous!\nLet's have a look at the formal expression:\n$$\n?x:a \\rightarrow b.x\\ e\n$$\nAt first look, my eyes parsed the expression as:\n$$\n(?x:a) \\rightarrow (b.x) e\n$$\nwhich is totally WRONG!\nThe correct grouping is\n$$\n(?x:(a \\rightarrow b).x)\\ e\n$$\nI really appreciate the great work of the author, but\n\nPlease use PARENTHESIS when necessary!\n\n","id":"https://noteoverflow.github.io/posts/evil-of-abusing-syntax/","title":"The evil of abusing syntax"},"https://noteoverflow.github.io/posts/fixpoint-combinator-in-rust/":{"body":"It has been many years since Haskell discovered the Y combinator(fix point combinator).\nIt's such a milestone that it makes lambda calculus turing complete.\nLet's try to implement it in Rust and have fun!\nFix point of a function\nWhat do we mean by \"fix point\"?\nWell, in fact, it's quite simple. A fix point of a function $f$ is a parameter $x$ with the following equation:\n$$\nf(x) = x\n$$\nThis does not seem to be fun...\nBut if we try to flip the equation, it's quite interesting:\n$$\nx = f(x) = f(f(x)) = f(f(f(x))) = f^n(x)\n$$\nIf we can find a fix point, then we have recursion and loops for free!\nNow suppose we want to build a magic wand Y, for any function $f$, whenever we apply the wand to $f$,\nwe automaically get the fix point of $f$, that is:\n$$\nY(f) = f(Y(f))\n$$\n$Y(f)$ becomes the fix point of function $f$!\nBut does this magic wand exist?

How do we pass the parameter f?\nRepeating self?\nIn method above we have no way of passing the function of itself f.\nBut we may imitate the function call itself:\n\nNo way out. If we are in dynamic typed languages then we are done.\nBut in static typed language like rust, we cannot express the type of this.\nTo see why, consider expand the type of this:\n\nWe are repeating the type again and again which leads to inifnite type!\nΩ combinator\nTyping is hard. Let's for now forget about types and focus on finding the general way to do recursion in dynamic typed languages. We are now convinced that recursion can definitely be implemented without name binding in dynamic typed languages(see previous section).\nRecall the pattern of repeating self, we can pass the function itself into itself:\n\nwhich looks weird.

The power of fix point arises when we try to abstract general effects!\nMemorizing fibbonacci\nThe fibbonacci series has a direct recursion implementation (in rust, for example):\n\nHowever, since fib is not efficient and has already been a fixed point, we cannot transform it into memorization version(i.e., the state side-effect):\n\nmfib is still $O(2^n)$!

+ V + O主谓宾\nS + V + C主系表（补语）\n\n其中，主谓宾中的宾语可能省略，因为动词本身就足够表达含义了。\n以上是传统语法的一种解说，在这里我提出一种更为简洁且符合直觉的一种形式：「修饰」。\n其实以上所有的句式都只是一种结构，即「主谓」：\n结构解释\nS + P主谓\n\n而\"V+O\"与\"V+C\"都只是谓语的一种形式。而「谓语」其实可以看作是一种对「主语」的「修饰」，这是一种非常典型的「后置修饰」。\n「后置修饰」我认为是英语乃至很多语言的核心，其本质原因在于语言需要一种从前往后的序列化表达，后置的修饰和补充便再自然不过了。\n这里我们已经提出了在主语之后增加谓语的一种「后置修饰」，其实还有很多其他类型的后置修饰，这里之所以单独将「主谓」结构重点提出是因为这种修饰由于使用频率非常之高，演变为了句子的基本结构。那么还有哪些「后置修饰」呢？\n以下参照下图的分表进行详细阐述：\n修饰类型结构\n前置修饰副词/形容词，助动词\n后置修饰谓语，宾语，副词/形容词，介词短语，从句\n特殊修饰动词变形\n\n宾语\n从上面的句子基本结构中，我们可以直接发现「主谓宾」的主谓结构暗示了「宾语」可以作为对「谓语动词」的一种修饰！\n举个例子，\"Tom likes math\"这个句子中，\"math\"作为谓语动词\"like\"的「后置修饰」，表达喜欢的是数学。这里有可以进一步引申出及物动词与不及物动词，不过我认为这种细节完全可以在积累中获得直觉，无需特别关注。\n副词后置\n现在我们已经有了第一种修饰「谓语动词」的方式即宾语，但是对于动词的修饰不止这一种，如果我们想要补充修饰的并非动词的对象，而是动作本身的一些性质，这时候我们就需要「副词」了。副词的位置其实是十分灵活的，其既可以后置修饰也可以「前置修饰」。\n形容词后置\n其实如果我们足够不严谨，可以不用去管一些副词和形容词的区别，但是我们还是尽可能保守一些，将形容词后置这种形式也单独列出，比如：\n\nSomeone else is watching TV.\n\n这里的\"else\"作为\"someone\"的后置修饰，其是一个形容词。\n介词短语\n接下来是一位重量级选手！上面我们针对名词和动词都分别有了两种「后置修饰」的方式，而「介词短语」两者都可以修饰！\n还记得上学的时候老师总是让我们记忆一些「动词固定搭配」，其实这些很多就是将「介词」或「介词短语」作为动词的后置修饰所表现出的结果。\n除了「后置修饰」，我们其实也有「前置修饰」，前置修饰往往比后置修饰联系更为强烈，语气更为突出，结构更为常用。我认为可以粗略分为「形容词前置」、「助动词」和「副词前置」。\n形容词/副词 前置\n这里我们把形容词前置和副词前置放在一起。形容词前置往往表达一种和修饰对象联系更为紧密更为本质的修饰（更符合汉语的习惯），副词前置很多情况下是为了语气的强调。\n动词变形\n在进入助动词之前，我们还需要了解一种特殊的，不规则的修饰，即「动词变形」。\n英语与汉语相比，有几个不一样的地方：\n\n需要专门指定量词，比如one, a, the, 以及动词后加s。\n需要将动词变形俩表达时间、语气、可能性等额外的信息。\n对人称的表示存在宾格，人称会随出现的位置而变形。\n\n这里最重要的是第二点，这一点引出了英语语法的无数表达方式，即动状词（动词变形）。\n作为谓语的动词部分，会由于不同使用的情景发生变化（单复数、时间、状态、语气、不确定性，etc）。\n举个例子：\n\nAll men are created equal.\n\n传统的英语语法大概会告诉我们：are created作为谓语存在。另外我们还发现create这个词变成了过去分词，配合be动词来表达被动的含义。\n这种动词的变化就是一种动词变形。这里我觉得其实将句型看作S+V+C更好一些，created是动词变形然后变成了一种形容词，有被动的含义。\n这类动词变形主要包括：过去分词、现在分词、单复数。其中现在分词和动名词很像，只不过动名词可以当作名词或名词短语使用。\n类型形式例子\n过去式v+ed, 不规则ate, wrote\n复数式v+s, 特殊词尾变化+sworks, studies\n分词v+ed, v+ing, 不规则eaten, done, working\n动名词v+ingdrinking\n\n上表整理了所有常见的动词变形类型。其中，前两种变形之后仍然用作动词，而「分词」可用作形容词或者动词的一部分，「动名词」则主要用于名词。\n分词是最需要关注和详细分辨的，很多时候分词直接当成了形容词，但是当处于助动词之后的时候就只是谓语动词的一部分。\n助动词\n除了动词本身的变化，经常我们还会发现动词可能和其它词一起构成谓语，比如be, have, will, can, could, to。\n这类词中，一些词用来表示不确定的语气：\n\nHe may be wrong.\n\n这里be动词前面使用了助动词may来表达不确定的语气，此外，could, might等也有不确定的语气。\n而will则是主要用于表示某种意愿和未来的事情（比如用在将来时态中），\nhave用于过去完成时表示已经完成的含义，不定式to do其实可以看作带有助动词的从句省略（后文进一步阐述）。\n从句\n现在我们有了基本句式、动词变形以及助动词补足语气，接下来让我们开启任何语言都十分重要的部分：组合。\n有了句子，自然会考虑如何将小句子组合成更大的句子，在编程语言中，我们有组合子；在英语中，我们有从句。\n其实「从句」也属于「后置修饰」！之所以放在最后一种修饰里，因为它是相对而言最丰富最复杂最重要的一种修饰！从句是后续进行「省略规则」的基础。\n传统语法喜欢将从句进行分类：\n\n名词从句\n副词从句\n关系从句\n\n这种分类是ok的，我们就按照这个分类进行讨论。考虑这样两个句子：\n\nHe said something.\n\n\nHe is a programmer.\n\n如果他说的内容就是第二句，即他想告诉我们他是个程序员，那么我们可以使用从句将这两句组合起来：\n\nHe said that he is a programmer.\n\n副词从句经常使用when, where等表达时间、地点等额外的信息修饰句子。\n省略\n自然语言往往会为了追求便捷性进行句子省略，同时显现出某种「言外之意」。\n有趣的是，许许多多复杂的英语语法可以被归纳为从句省略：\n\n不定式是从句中有助动词时的一种省略\n主谓宾补是从句为SVC结构时的一种省略\n同位语也是SVC的一种省略表达\n\n省略的原则十分简单：\n\n省略从句中主语与 be 动词，只保留补语部分。\n\n\n\nTODO

I successfully implement Linear Algebraic Effect(Linear AE) in Rust!\nYou may ask, what exactly is Linear AE?\nWell, honestly, the word 'linear' is used by myself to mean one-shot, which implies the effect cannot be cloned casually. AE is a special kind of structure like \"exceptions can return\".\nI'm not going to explain AE in detail in this post. Let's jump into rust's implementation!\nThe experimental Coroutine trait\nYes rust already has a trait called Coroutine whose definition is:\n\nThe associated type Coroutine::Yield means the yielded type of the coroutine and the type Coroutine::Return refers to the type of returned value. For example:\n\nThe generated coroutine generator acts like a simple iterator which yields integers from 0 to 10.\nTherefore the Yield type of generator is i32 and type Return is ().\nNow let's focus on the method Corouine::resume.\nresume takes a pinned self since the coroutine itself may contain self-referential pointers just like those in Future. Every time one resume with a parameter, the coroutine returns a CoroutineState to indicate whether it should return or yield. For instance:\n\nYield as effects\nSince rust's compiler can automatically transform our coroutine into a stackless state machine, we can directly utilize it's Yield type to implement effects!\nConsider a common logging effect, let's define it as a common data strucutre:\n\nThe we can create a coroutine to yield Log:\n\nIf you try to write may_log's type, You will find that the Yield type can indicate that, while executing the coroutine, it may yield logging:\n\nNotably, yield is a expression which can return value which will be filled as parameters while resuming.\nLet's abstract this pattern a little.\nFirstly, we can model effects as various kinds of data such as\n\nThen we write our program logic as a coroutine which yields its requiring effect:\n\nFinally, we write a data structure to resume the coroutine until it returns.\nComposing effectful programs\nWe can now create effectful programs. But how can we compose them?\nCoroutines are not like normal functions, they will not return until it yields all effects.\nIf we write:\n\nWe are expecting a as the returned result of calling coroutine.\nTherefore we need to comsume all its effects:\n\nThis is also a common pattern, so let's write a macro:\n\nNow we can simply write to compose effectful programs:\n\nEpilogue\nThis a demo

language has polymorphism functions. Some utilize dynamic interfaces, some invent generics and typeclass to overload behavories.\nRust has both.\nIn Rust, we have type parameters and traits.\nRust really prefer generics over existential types. If one want to be Debug, just \"generic\" it:\n\nWe also have associated types, where clauses, impl types, etc.\nThese all lift our type to polymorphism. However, there still exists two kinds of polymorphism which are somewhat hard to achieve in Rust now.\nEffect polymorphism\nIt's somewhat hard to explain what effect is because side-effects is nearly everywhere and we can't live without it!\nEffects are everything except for function input/output. Think about errors, asynchrony, uncertainty. Think about it and try to guess what they correspond to in out daily programming.\nYes, they are Result&lt;_&gt;, Future&lt;Output=_&gt; and various kinds of containers.

In Rust, abstracting effects is really really hard right now. If you want to write one API for both sync and async codes, I just suggest you to write two separate traits.\nOwnership polymorphism\nAnother one is ownership, which is also ubiquitous in Rust.\nSuppose you want write some AST like:\n\nApparently this does not compile since Expr is not Sized.\nWe have to add some ownership for every recurrent position. For example:\n\nHowever, Box has exclusive ownership, what about Rc or even Arc?\nYou can just abstract the whole recurrent type as:\n\nExpr is a fixpoint! This way we now have infinite type.\nHow about just abstract HKT?\n\nHKTs are really useful on abstracting * -&gt; * types!\nI believe in the future, we can have effect polymorphism with Coroutine one-shot algebraic effects and ownership polymorphism with GAT and impl type alias.\n","id":"https://noteoverflow.github.io/posts/polymorphism-in-rust/","title":"Polymorphism in Rust"},"https://noteoverflow.github.io/posts/product-coproduct-coincide-abel-group/":{"body":"It's rather beautiful that product and coproduct (sum) coinsides in the category of Abelian groups.\nRecall that product object is a universal construct which satisfies a spectial pattern:\n\nGiven two groups $A, B$, there can be constructed a product object $A \\times B$\nwith two projections $p$ and $q$ so that $p(a, b) = a$ and $q(a, b) = b$.\n\nThe product must satisfy a universal property which can be demostrated as the following commutative graph:\n\n\n\n  \n  \n\n\nAccroding to above graph, given any group $X$ with projections:\n\n$f: X \\rightarrow A$ and \n$g: X \\rightarrow B$\n\nthere exists unique homomorphism $h: X \\rightarrow A \\times B$ satisfying\n\n$p \\circ h = f$ and\n$q \\circ h = g$.\n\nApparently, $h$ can be defined as:\n\n$h(x) = (f(x), g(x))$\n\nNow, let's prove that the product constructed above is also a coproduct is all groups are abelian.\nFirst of all, we define two injections:\n\n$i: A \\rightarrow A \\times B,\\ i(a) = (a, 0)$\n$j: B \\rightarrow A \\times B,\\ j(b) = (b, 0)$\n\nGiven other injections:\n\n$f: A \\rightarrow X$ and $g: B \\rightarrow X$,\n\nWe need to find a unique morphism $h: A \\times B \\rightarrow X$ so that\n\n$h \\circ i = f$ and\n$h \\circ j = g$\n\nFortunately, $h$ can be defined as\n\n$h(a, b) = f(a) + g(b)$\n\nIt's easy to verify that $h$ is a homomorphism:\n$h(a_1​,b_1​)+h(a_2​,b_2​)$\n$= f(a_1​)+g(b_1​)+f(a_2​)+g(b_2​)$\n$= f(a_1​+a_2​)+g(b_1​+b_2​)$\n$= h((a_1​,b_1​)+(a_2​,b_2​))$\nand\n\n$h \\circ i​(a) = h(a,0) = f(a)$  \n$h \\circ j​(b) = h(0,b) = g(b)$\n","id":"https://noteoverflow.github.io/posts/product-coproduct-coincide-abel-group/","title":"Product and coproduct coinsides in the category of Abelian groups"},"https://noteoverflow.github.io/posts/relaxed-ordering-and-visibility/":{"body":"I'm really curious that whether the relaxed memory ordering can ensure to see\nthe last recent value in the total modification order.

的内容。\n形容词，副词等传统语法中的分类的修饰关系更加显然。\nSNAP\n接下来我们进入SNAP的核心，即根据修饰关系的结构进行粗略的分类。我们可以把修饰的结构按照其是否自我修饰和修饰语序分为如下：\n名称结构说明\nN$x \\rightarrow x$自修饰\nA$x \\rightarrow$前置他修饰\nP$\\rightarrow x$后置他修饰\n\n我们来举几个例子。\n比如名词或名词短语均为N，所有形容词类均可作为A，而P十分复杂，我们需要专门来讨论他。\nP在传统语法中可以有如下几种可能：\n\nverb obj.\nlinking-verb complement\nadv.\nclause\nobj.\n\n具体而言，前两种是句子谓语的构成方式，即「动词+宾语」和「系动词+补语」。\n后三种分别为「副词」、「从句」和「宾语」（没错，宾语可以看作修饰前面的动词！）。\n有了这些概念我们就可以定义什么是句子，也就是SNAP中的S。\n\n句子（S）即 使用N开头，并使用上述前两种P作为开头的后置修饰的结构。\n\n这么一来，从句也就顺理成章的可以被识别了。\n转换\n在英语中，一个词的分类不是固定的（或者，如果你喜欢类型论，可以认为同一个词可以在不同类型之间被影射）。\n\n分类不是由词本身决定，而是由其在句子中的结构和身份来决定。\n\n建立了这种观念之后，我们就可以分类讨论不同的转换：\n\n\n\nNAP转换\n首先我们关注 NAP 这三剑客。\n$N \\rightarrow A$\n「自修饰体」可以转换为「前置他修饰体」。\n这十分常见，比如 \"book shelf\" 其中 book 本是自修饰的名词，此处却被作为前置修饰用来修饰 shelf。\n$N \\rightarrow P$\n「自修饰体」可以转换为「后置修饰体」。\n这也非常常见，主要有以下两大情况：\n\n作为宾语修饰动作：比如 \"play piano\" 中 piano 后置修饰 play;\n加上系动词作为谓语：比如 \"He is Tom\" 中 Tom 加上 is 即可后置修饰 He;\n\n$P \\rightarrow N$\n「后置修饰体」可转换为「自修饰体」。\n比如动名词和动名词短语。\n$A \\rightarrow P$\n「前置修饰体」可转换为「后置修饰体」\n比如通过增加系动词转换为谓语。\n有比如宾语补语、同位语等。\n$P \\rightarrow A$\n部分「后置修饰体」可转换为「前置修饰体」。\n注意这里仅是部分可转换。\n比如部分简单动词可以通过「动状词」转换为形容词。\nS 转换\nS 可以被转换为 NP 其一，其实就是传统语法中的各种从句。\n这里由于时间原因不再赘述，仅进行如下梳理：\n结构说明\n$S \\rightarrow N$名词性从句\n$S \\rightarrow P$定语从句，关系从句\n\n不规则修饰\n除了上述根据语序可大致划分的修饰之外，其实还有不规则的修饰方式。\n根据「时态」和「语气」可以对动词进行各种变形，这些均属于不规则修饰（即同时前置，后置，还有可能是不规则变化）。\n这类需要专门处理。\n\n省略\n接下来进入第二块拼图：「省略」。\n省略是一种十分强大的工具，省略的通则是：\n\n省略从句中的主语与系动词，只留补语。\n\n可是如果从句中没有系动词和补语怎么办？没关系，我们还有下面两条补充规则：\n有助动词时，变成不定词\nYou must go at once.\n→ You are to go at once. （你必须马上离开。）\nThe train will leave in 10 minutes.\n→ The train is to leave in 10 minutes. （火车 10 分钟后开动。）\nHe should do as I say.\n→ He is to do as I say. （他该按我说的去做。）\nYou may call me \"Sir.\"\n→ You are to call me \"Sir.\" （你可以叫我“先生”。）\n无助动词时，变成V-ing\n\n概率\n以上使用「修饰」和「省略」的语法系统是十分粗略的，现实世界中有许多特殊情况和惯用法，需要在日常使用中去习惯和积累，这里推荐一本书：\nEnglish Grammar in
