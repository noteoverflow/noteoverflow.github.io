describe the core rules of the algorithm, I want to use a special DSL which is drived from Datalog:\nMeta-language\nThe lanugage we use to describe rules has only 2 basic components:\nAtomic entity\nIf a entity derives itself, we call it atomic entity (usually they are the input of the algorithm). For instance:\n\nWe can also view this entity as a type:\n\nWe use a spectial kind Input to imply that the entity is atomic.\nDerived entity\nThis kind of entities can be derived from others (even recursively!):\n\nHere trans serves as a deriving rule.\nMaterials\nBefore demonstrating the whole algorithm, we firstly prepare some materials to cook.\n$G$ the CFG\nAs in the traditional algorithm, we need the Control Flow Graph(CFG), denoted $G$, to help us trace program and memory flow.\nThe CFG comprises set of MIR Point, denoted $P$ and control flow edges between points $E$.\nTo get the source and destination of one edge, we have two functions:\n\nSince we are working on the meta-language, we say edge e exists by:\n\nNormally, we denote one edge as edge a b by its end points.\n$R$ the Regions\nRegion is the core concept of the borrow checker.\nThen what do we mean by a region?\nLet's consider how to assemble references and memory locations in Rust!\nBasically, we use product type, or, if you like, structs:\n\nSimilarly, We just define regions as products of references.\nHowever, as we want to be more specific here, we call referred references loans:\n\nRegions are sets of loans.\n\nMoreover, since regions can be viewed as sets, we then have subset relations which is explored in the next section.\n$L$ the Loans\nIn the previous part, we used loans to define regions.\nLoans can be viewed as any borrow sites.\nFor example:\n\nHere, the region 'a would correspond to the set {L0, L1}, since it may refer to data produced by the loan L0, but it may also refer to data from the loan L1.\nRelations\nInjection\nWe mentioned that regions can form subset relations.\nBut we can say more general here by defining relation structures between regions at the same point.\n\nTo simplify the notation a little, we denote a in b at p just as in p a b.\n\nAlso, we have some input injection relations:\n\nand one more rule:\n\nLiveness\na region 'a is live at some point P if some reference with type &amp;'a i32 may be dereferenced later:\n\nWe also talk about liveness of loans:\n\nWhat's require here?\nRequirement\nrequire R L P means:\n\nIf the terms of the loan L are violated at the point P, then the region R is invalidated.\n\nFormally:\n\nand rules:\n\nInvalidation\nAnd now finally we can define what a borrow check error is.\nBefore that, We need to define an input invalidates(P, L),\nwhich indicates that some access or action at the point P invalidates the terms of the loan L:\n\nErrors\nFinally\n\nRefinement\nThe core algorithm is rather coarse.\nWe need refinements to handle reassignment and reborrow problems.\nReassignment\nReborrow\n","id":"https://noteoverflow.github.io/posts/another-view-of-rust-s-lifetime-ii-the-algorithm/","title":"Another view of Rust's lifetime II - The algorithm"},"https://noteoverflow.github.io/posts/another-view-of-rusts-lifetime/":{"body":"Compared with Haskell, Rust is different for its effect system and ownership system.\nInside ownership system, lifetime plays an important role on borrowing and safety.\nTraditionally, people think about lifetime as some region of code, which is a little kind of vague.\nWhy not try to see lifetime as a kind of memory(dependency) reference?\nLifetime as scope?\nThe Rust book suggests viewing lifetime as scopes. Consider a simple example:\n\nSince x's lifetime 'b is shorter than r's 'a, we cannot assign &amp;x to r.\nHowever, this reason is rather imprecise.\nIf we simply remove the last println! line, this code just compile fine.:\n\nWhy?\nEven worse, lifetime can contain holes, where it’s intermittently invalid between where it starts and where it ultimately ends. For example, let's change our previous code simply:\n\nThis time the code compiles. Surprise!\nWhy? why this code compiles fine?? If r's lifetime coprresponds to x's reference, why r can br printed outside x's scope now? There may exist holes in lifetime.\nApparently scope view is not correct. We need something better.\nLifetime as regions of code?\nRustonomicon the book suggests viewing lifetime as named regions of code.\nNow our previous problems are solved, since 'r spans only its valid data flow regions and the regions can contains arbitrary holes.\n\nLifetime is named regions of code where the pointed data is valid.\n\nWhat about lifetime constraints like 'a: 'b?\nLifetime subtyping\nSubtyping is really just a spectial relation just as other traits can represent.\nThe only subtyping in rust is lifetime subtyping.\n\nif 'b outlives 'a, then 'b: 'a and &amp;'b T is a subtype of &amp;'a T.\n\nSince &amp;'b T is a subtype of &amp;'a T, we can assign any &amp;'b T to &amp;'a T.\nFor example(again from the rust book):\n\nActually, this code cannot compile without lifetime subtyping. It's equivalent to this code:\n\nAutomatic subtyping is only a fancy and convenient way to expression this relationship.\nLifetime as memory references\nIf you know category theory, you may heard of duality.\nJust like category theory, the code region view also has its DUAL view:\n\nA lifetime refers to some memory or other resources and\nconstraint 'a: 'b can also be read 'a refers to a subset of 'b or, if you like, 'a in 'b.\n\nIn this dual view, if 'a outlives 'b, 'b contains more resources than 'a does.\nI find this view is somehow complement to the region view.\nLet's demonstrate this view with the following code:\n\n\nwhere arrow -&gt; means point to some resource and {} means union.\nFrom this graph, we can easily conclude:\n\n","id":"https://noteoverflow.github.io/posts/another-view-of-rusts-lifetime/","title":"Another view of Rust's lifetime"},"https://noteoverflow.github.io/posts/bash-may-swallow-signals/":{"body":"Recently I encountered a confusing bug:\n\nA simple eprintln! in Rust may cause panic!\n\nThat sounds weird, right?\nLet's check the eprintln!'s doc:\n\nPrints to the standard error, with a newline.\nEquivalent to the println! macro, except that output goes to\nio::stderr instead of io::stdout.

Any traditional algorithm which can be finished in finite steps can also be expressed with lambda calculus and recursions. In a nutshell, lambda calculus is turing complete!\n\nThe ultimate principal\nWait! Our mission should be positing a uniform principal of problem solving.\nWhy bother wasting time on lambda calculus and recursions?\nNow let me show you the magic! It can be described informally as:\n\nAll problems can be deconstructed by its input, output and side-effect.\nWe can recursively divide the problem until we can solve it trivially.\nFinally, we merge all recursive solutions and get the global solution.\n\nActually, there's nothing novel here. This principal is just trying to reintroduce one archaic motto:\n\nAll algorithms can be constructed by divide and conquer.\n\nThe only difference is that the archaic principal said nothing about what to divide.\nAlthough this principal is so simple that it's even hard to be seen as a discovery, to actually use it, it's much much hard and there exists so many pitfalls.\nMost pitfalls are basically that, most materials and people failed to follow the principal， let alone finding tricks of it. Here I only enumerate some of crux tricks (someday I may write a systemaic book on this).\nTricks\nRecursion as loops\nAll recursions can be converted to equivalent version of loops with extra data structure(such as stack).\nIn fact, all stack based compilers do this for you automatically.\n\n\nshow one perticular example\n\nNot only input, but also output!\nOne common misunderstanding is problems can only be divided by input.\nIn practice, dividing output is quite useful and ubiquitous.\nWhenever you have difficulty dividing on input, just try output!\n\nAll information (data) representing part of the problem can be divided.\nAlthough different dividing startegies can lead to different complexities.\n\nRecursion on side effect\nMany people insist that many problems can not be solve by divide and conquer as the dividing is not local and cannot be merged into the global solution. However, they all ignored some very critical aspect: the side-effect of functions (algorithms).\nIn theory, side-effect should be anything that can influence referential transparency.\nThe most interesting fact is that, if you think carefully, effects can be classified into compile-time and run-time.\nRun-time effect: extra information\nFor a problem, the result of our recursion is not simply returning a local solution in most scenarios. I find that we usually need additional recursive information. This is a bit abstract, so let me give you an example, using the sliding window that we often see:\nSliding windows are typically described by divide and conquer:\nfor an input list, decompose it into a list consisting of the last element and all the previous elements.\nAssuming that I have obtained the solution of all the previous elements (except the last element) through recursion, then we will find that the solution of the first half alone is not enough to support us to get a new solution after incorporating the last element.\nSo we can simply include an additional information, that is, assume that the recursion of the first half can return us an additional information,\nthis additional information contains some information about the sequence adjacent to the last element (in fact, this sequence is what many people call a sliding window).\nUsing this additional information, we find that we can easily update the global solution.\nOf course, don't forget that this extra information is recursive. When you require the first half to recursively return the extra information, you must also be able to return the updated extra information (which can be compared to the sliding update of a sliding window). Similarly, if you want to get extra information you want from the upper layer, make sure you can then provide it to the next layer. Although the sliding window is used as an example here, the application scope of the extra information technique is actually much more than that. You will find that monotone stacks, double pointers, prefix sums, etc. are all just special cases of extra information recursion.\nCompile-time effect: constraints and proofs\nCompile-time effects are rare to mention but also ubiquitous!\nBesides decomposing on run-time data, you can even divide constraints (proofs)!\nIf you are familiar with dependent type theory, then this is much natural.\nDivide one aspect at a time, never both\nSo you start trying to decompose any data that you think might be useful, but remember never to consider decomposition in multiple dimensions.\nInstead, decompose the first data (dimension) first, and then consider whether to decompose the second dimension. Otherwise, you will definitely fall into chaos.\nThe most typical example is high-dimensional dynamic optimization.\nFor this kind of problem, you must not rush to decompose it all at once, as you cannot eat hot tofu in a hurry.\nDefer dividing\nActually, most problems tagged easy and medium can be divided directly by its input and output.\nThe real hard part is lying under the target to be divided.\nFor instance, in designing the famous quick sort, one learns to rearrange the target array before dividing and recursion. the rearrange can effecttively efface the cost of merging after the recursion which is inevitable in merge sort.\nMoreover, many hard problems do not directly divide on input or output, nor the given effects.\nTo solve them, one need to design and find a way to effectively construct a new data structure to be divided and recur.\nReuse space\nWhen you try to design additional information again, you may find that the memory used to store the additional information can be reused. In this case, you must try to reuse this memory, which can usually greatly reduce space complexity.\nCaching\nDon't be afraid of dynamic programming.\nJust list the recursive formula of recursive divide and conquer, and then use a hashMap to cache the results.\nIf you find that there is no circular dependency in the recursion, then you don't even need a hash.\nA simple array plus the space reuse mentioned above can solve all dynamic programming.\nPruning\nSubproblems can be pruned. Greedy algorithms and early termination with backtracking are both trivially applicable.\nCatamorphisms and recursion schemes\nF-algebra\n\n\ncomplete formal description after\n\nBasic cata\n\nThe dividing-and-conquer part can be described by catamorphism.\nHowever, in many situations, one need to find a effective target data structure to be divided first which is the real enigma.

How do we pass the parameter f?\nRepeating self?\nIn method above we have no way of passing the function of itself f.\nBut we may imitate the function call itself:\n\nNo way out. If we are in dynamic typed languages then we are done.\nBut in static typed language like rust, we cannot express the type of this.\nTo see why, consider expand the type of this:\n\nWe are repeating the type again and again which leads to inifnite type!\nΩ combinator\nTyping is hard. Let's for now forget about types and focus on finding the general way to do recursion in dynamic typed languages.

But remember in this way we can pass the function itself into f?\nLet try to pass it:\n\nand try to reduce it(replace f in the first lambda with the passed parameter):\n\nWOW we just get the original expression back!\nThis kind of combinator is so interesting that we call it the Ω combinator:\n$$\n\\omega(x) = x(x)\n$$\n\nomega =&gt; OMG it's a recursion without name binding!\n\nRecursive type\n\nTyping is hard.\n\nWe are now getting really close to the real magic wand!\nBut we still need to fix the infinite type problem.\nRemember, whenever you find something not exist, just create it!\nLet's create the infinite type in rust's type system.\nThe first step of any creation if to try to express it in some way.\nSince we cannot directly express the inifinity, we pass the repeating part as parameter:\n\nThen we define a new operation unfold:\n\ne[a/b] means to replace all occurences of b to a.

In Rust, abstracting effects is really really hard right now.

For example:\n\nHowever, Box has exclusive ownership, what about Rc or even Arc?\nYou can just abstract the whole recurrent type as:\n\nExpr is a fixpoint! This way we now have infinite type.\nHow about just abstract HKT?\n\nHKTs are really useful on abstracting * -&gt; * types!\nI believe in the future, we can have effect polymorphism with Coroutine one-shot algebraic effects and ownership polymorphism with GAT and impl type alias.\n","id":"https://noteoverflow.github.io/posts/polymorphism-in-rust/","title":"Polymorphism in Rust"},"https://noteoverflow.github.io/posts/relaxed-ordering-and-visibility/":{"body":"I'm really curious that whether the relaxed memory ordering can ensure to see\nthe last recent value in the total modification order.

\\rightarrow y\n$$\n这里表示$x$修饰$y$。\n举几个例子。比如常见的句子构成「主谓」结构：\n\nTom likes learning math.\n\n此处 \"likes learning math\" 作为谓语修饰主语 \"Tom\" ，而 \"learning math\" 又用来修饰 \"likes\" 来补全 \"likes\" 的内容。\n形容词，副词等传统语法中的分类的修饰关系更加显然。\nSNAP\n接下来我们进入SNAP的核心，即根据修饰关系的结构进行粗略的分类。我们可以把修饰的结构按照其是否自我修饰和修饰语序分为如下：\n名称结构说明\nN$x \\rightarrow x$自修饰\nA$x \\rightarrow$前置他修饰\nP$\\rightarrow x$后置他修饰\n\n我们来举几个例子。\n比如名词或名词短语均为N，所有形容词类均可作为A，而P十分复杂，我们需要专门来讨论他。\nP在传统语法中可以有如下几种可能：\n\nverb obj.\nlinking-verb complement\nadv.\nclause\nobj.\n\n具体而言，前两种是句子谓语的构成方式，即「动词+宾语」和「系动词+补语」。\n后三种分别为「副词」、「从句」和「宾语」（没错，宾语可以看作修饰前面的动词！）。\n有了这些概念我们就可以定义什么是句子，也就是SNAP中的S。\n\n句子（S）即 使用N开头，并使用上述前两种P作为开头的后置修饰的结构。\n\n这么一来，从句也就顺理成章的可以被识别了。\n转换\n在英语中，一个词的分类不是固定的（或者，如果你喜欢类型论，可以认为同一个词可以在不同类型之间被影射）。\n\n分类不是由词本身决定，而是由其在句子中的结构和身份来决定。\n\n建立了这种观念之后，我们就可以分类讨论不同的转换：\n\n\n\nNAP转换\n首先我们关注 NAP 这三剑客。\n$N \\rightarrow A$\n「自修饰体」可以转换为「前置他修饰体」。\n这十分常见，比如 \"book shelf\" 其中 book 本是自修饰的名词，此处却被作为前置修饰用来修饰 shelf。\n$N \\rightarrow P$\n「自修饰体」可以转换为「后置修饰体」。\n这也非常常见，主要有以下两大情况：\n\n作为宾语修饰动作：比如 \"play piano\" 中 piano 后置修饰 play;\n加上系动词作为谓语：比如 \"He is Tom\" 中 Tom 加上 is 即可后置修饰 He;\n\n$P \\rightarrow N$\n「后置修饰体」可转换为「自修饰体」。\n比如动名词和动名词短语。\n$A \\rightarrow P$\n「前置修饰体」可转换为「后置修饰体」\n比如通过增加系动词转换为谓语。\n有比如宾语补语、同位语等。\n$P \\rightarrow A$\n部分「后置修饰体」可转换为「前置修饰体」。\n注意这里仅是部分可转换。\n比如部分简单动词可以通过「动状词」转换为形容词。\nS 转换\nS 可以被转换为 NP 其一，其实就是传统语法中的各种从句。\n这里由于时间原因不再赘述，仅进行如下梳理：\n结构说明\n$S \\rightarrow N$名词性从句\n$S \\rightarrow P$定语从句，关系从句\n\n不规则修饰\n除了上述根据语序可大致划分的修饰之外，其实还有不规则的修饰方式。\n根据「时态」和「语气」可以对动词进行各种变形，这些均属于不规则修饰（即同时前置，后置，还有可能是不规则变化）。\n这类需要专门处理。\n\n省略\n接下来进入第二块拼图：「省略」。\n省略是一种十分强大的工具，省略的通则是：\n\n省略从句中的主语与系动词，只留补语。\n\n可是如果从句中没有系动词和补语怎么办？没关系，我们还有下面两条补充规则：\n有助动词时，变成不定词\nYou must go at once.\n→ You are to go at once. （你必须马上离开。）\nThe train will leave in 10 minutes.\n→ The train is to leave in 10 minutes. （火车 10 分钟后开动。）\nHe should do as I say.\n→ He is to do as I say. （他该按我说的去做。）\nYou may call me \"Sir.\"\n→ You are to call me \"Sir.\" （你可以叫我“先生”。）\n无助动词时，变成V-ing\n\n概率\n以上使用「修饰」和「省略」的语法系统是十分粗略的，现实世界中有许多特殊情况和惯用法，需要在日常使用中去习惯和积累，这里推荐一本书：\nEnglish Grammar in
